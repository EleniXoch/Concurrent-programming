FIFO Pipe Library functions with running example  


Description of each funtion:

-void pipe_init(int size);

Creates and initialises the pipe with size "int size".


-void pipe_write(char c);

Writes the next byte "char c" to the pipe. Active waiting if 
the pipe is full.

-int pipe_read(char* c);

Reads the next byte from the pipe and stores it to "char* c".
Returns 0 if the pipe is empty, 1 if read was successful.


-void pipe_destroy();

Frees the allocated memory for the pipe.


-void pipe_writeDone();

Notifies the pipe that no more bytes are going to be written.



Given example: 

 program to copy files using FIFO pipeline and threads
 write thread and read thread are implemented using pipe_library functions
